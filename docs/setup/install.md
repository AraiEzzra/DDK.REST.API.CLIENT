# Install

Before starting, you need to create a Docker network

This is necessary in case you connect to your blockchain node located on the same machine

If you already configured the Docker network when starting the blockchain node, you can skip this step

To install, enter the following command in the docker folder:

```bash
sh install.sh
```
